# Match3Lines
This game was created with pygame. It is a copy of an old game that I played.
Images of the game were downloaded from 'www.pixabay.com'.
The music and sounds were downloaded from 'www.pacdv.com/sounds/'.

This game has been tested only in windows.

You need Python 3 installed in your system.
if you already have Python then you have to install the dependencies
executing the next command:

````shell script
pip install -r riquirements.txt
